After the creating the Python file : 

1)Created a batch file out of the python program by:

	1.1)Opening notepad and typing the location of python.exe on my system(between inverted commas)
  
	1.2)After a space,i added the location of the python file(between inverted commas)
  
	1.3)Typed pause in the next line and saved the text file with the extension ".bat"
  
2)After creating the batch file, I put that file into the location:
`C:\users\myuser\appdata\roaming\microsoft\windows\startmenu\programs\startup\`

3)This location of the batch file will help us in the automatic execution of the program.

4)After the program is executed the user gets 3 options to choose from and the rest is taken care of by technology! Hands free entertainment.

### Note: In order to run the program, module "pyautogui" must be installed, without this it would raise an error!
